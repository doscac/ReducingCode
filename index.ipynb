    "\n",
    "__Welcome to \"The Debugging Book\"!__ \n",
    "Software has bugs, and finding bugs can involve lots of effort.  This book addresses this problem by _automating_ software debugging, specifically by _locating errors and their causes automatically_.  Recent years have seen the development of novel techniques that lead to dramatic improvements in automated software debugging.  They now are mature enough to be assembled in a book â€“ even with executable code. "

You can download the code as Python programs; simply select \"Resources $\\rightarrow$ Download Code\" for one chapter or \"Resources $\\rightarrow$ All Code\" for all chapters.  These code files can be executed, yielding (hopefully) the same results as the notebooks.  Once the book is out of beta, you can also [install the Python package](Importing.ipynb).\n",

    "The interactive notebook uses the [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) service, which runs notebooks on their own servers.  Starting Jupyter through mybinder.org normally takes about 30 seconds, depending on your Internet connection. If, however, you are the first to invoke binder after a book update, binder recreates its environment, which will take a few minutes.  Reload the page occasionally."
